# Planning a website

You've learned some of the building blocks for semantic websites. HTML gives us structure for the _content of the page_, but what is that content going to be?

In this section, you're going to create a draft sitemap for your unit project. A sitemap is a diagram helping you understand the big picture - the _architecture_ of your website before you start building so you can work effectively and efficiently.

1. Note down things you want to have in common on each page. These could be things like navigation elements, footers, logos...anything that appears more than once.
2. Sketch out what you want the layout to look like. **We have not learned this yet**, but it will help you plan ahead for later stages.
3. Brainstorm _unique_ content for each page. What is the main topic?
4. Try and sort the content into groups. Are there patterns? Things you can put together in similar places?
5. Sketch out a rough sitemap - have a bubble for each page, grouping elements together based on your brainstorms. Each page should be its own bubble with notes on how to link between each page. The navigation menu might be enough to do this, but not in every case.
