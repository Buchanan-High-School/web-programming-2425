HTML documents have block-level elements which are used to semantically contain other elements. These block elements help define the structure of your page as well as the content that goes into those sections. 

There are common structures for all HTML pages:

1. Header <head>
2. Navigation <nav>
3. Main content <main>
4. Sidebar <aside>
5. Footer <footer>

These elements can be laid out in different ways, so don't think too much about _where_ they are on the page but rather _what they're for_. This helps you create a consistent page and will help readers navigate and find information quickly and easily. From the Mozilla Developer Network:

"In your HTML code, you can mark up sections of content based on their functionality â€” you can use elements that represent the sections of content described above unambiguously, and assistive technologies like screen readers can recognize those elements and help with tasks like "find the main navigation", or "find the main content.""

There are two generic wrappers which have no meaning:

1. <div> - block level wrapper
2. <span> - inline wrapper

We can also break our content using line breaks, <br />, and horizontal rules, <hr />. These are used to maintain consistent line lengths or add visual cues that the content is shifting in perspective or tone.

There isn't much to do in this section. Go to the MDN documentation and look up each element above and define it's purpose. Where does it fit in your page? What kind of information would you include on your own site?
