				<em>really</em> didn't like chemistry in high school) and I'm excited to teach this new programming
				class.

			<p>Here are the places I've taught, in order:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Seoul, South Korea</li>
				<li>Evansville, Indiana</li>
				<li>South Bend, Indiana</li>
				<li>Elkhart, Indiana</li>
				<li>Buchanan, Michigan</li>
