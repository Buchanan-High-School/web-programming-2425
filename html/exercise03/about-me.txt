Mini-Project #1 - All about you!

It's time to get your finger exercises in and start writing some code. You must create an About Me page that has the following:

- Your name
- Your grade
- Your email address as a link. Bonus points for using the correct attribute to make the link open the user's email client.

Five links that you use on a regular basis in a list element.

A biography telling your history of school. Specifically, I'd like answers to the following questions:
    *What different schools have you attended?
    *What teacher had the greatest influence on you (so far)? Why?
    *What are your favorite things to learn in school?
	*What are your favorite things to learn outside of school?
    *What are the biggest challenges you have as a student?
    *What do you most want to make with the knowledge you will learn in this class?
    
You can use the template attached or create your own from scratch. Title the file as `yourName.html`.
