  The document object is the entry point for working with the DOM. An object can hold data or functions, called _methods_.

  The .querySelector() method is a function which access different parts of the DOM tree. You can get any element on your page using the element type (button, html, etc) or a CSS class or ID.

  You can access each DOM node directly or set them as _variables_ like we did below. A variable is a keyword used to identify something else. It does two things:
    1. The code is easier to read because you're not constantly typing document.querySelector() over and over.
    2. It makes your code more readable.

  Variables can be whatever you want them to be. The convention in Javascript is to use uppercase words _except_ for the first word in the name.

    Each element on the DOM tree has attributes which can _also_ be accessed. You can set the value of any of these attributes using Javascript which will immediately change on the page.

    Here, we're accessing the <html> element and toggling the class "inverted". The same change in HTML would look like this:

    <html class="inverted">...</html>

    DOM attributes do not always match what we call those same attributes in HTML. In our HTML pages, it would just be <html class="...">, but it can hold many values, so JS calls it `classList`. 

    .toggle() is a method (a function) which handles some kind of action. It will flip back and forth between adding and removing "inverted" from the <html> element's class. This immediately applies our CSS rules.

    JS has true or false values which can be checked to do different things. In this case, we're checking the current state of the "inverted" value. If it is true, then change it to light mode. If it is false, then change it to dark.
